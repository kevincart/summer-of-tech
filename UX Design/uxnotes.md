Problem statements and Prototyping

## Problem statements
'Should' "I should be able to..."
Pain point? Why, what is the root reason. What is the cost to you?
'How' How can the problem be solved? What will the benefit of solving the problem be?

## Fail cheaply
Be aware of the framing of this statement, and how that could affect the implementation.
