- Penetration tests
- Network access can dramatically reveal power

## Soft Skills
Follow your passion - to a point
Someone will notice - will never happen

Meritocracy is not real.

### Adversarial Thinking
- Where do I want to be?
- How do I get there?
- What's in it for me?
- Amoral, not immoral.

### Foundations
- Workplace appropriate conversations.
- How does the group reach consensus?
- Learn to be noncommittal ("Fair enough.")
- Learn empathy.
- Learn to deal with conflict.
- Always be physically safe.
- Ensure people always consider you to be a good person to converse with!
- Get a business card.
- 30 second introduction. (50 - 70 words TOTAL).
- Covers: Where you're from, what you want to do, what your education or experience is, what you bring to others.
- More dangerous techniques: interesting questions or opinions; name dropping (authentication for humans);

### Target Selection
- OSINT. Everything publicly available.
- What spaces do the people you want to connect to occupy?
- How can you get there?
- How can you belong there?
- Project your identity onto others, via meetups, industry events, etc.
- Find commonalities
- Have a question ready!
- Find the hyperconnected individuals. (Hyperconnected nodes have an order of magnitude more connections than others..)

### Passive Recon
- Observe without intrusion, listen, ask questions, etc.
- Computers don't lie, if you ask them what they are, they will tell you (for now).
- Undertake a normal interaction, and observe...
- Research organizations, look at the website.
- Know how to interact with people.
- Look up annual reports, business listings, org charts, etc.

### Active Recon
- Sometimes you can just ask.
- Go to their events, bring something to the table.
- Apply for a position you don't want first.

### Vulnerability Analysis
- What do they need?
- How can you help them?
- Where can you add or demonstrate value?
- Suggest ways to help them!
