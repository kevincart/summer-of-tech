# Git Notes - Git 101
git 101 - 24/07/2017

These notes are from Summer of Tech, and my own personal learning.

# Git
- Project-based file tracking management.
- Widely-used method of keeping of track of your projects and files, includes the ability to push and pull changes to and from remote references.

# Basic Git Operations
- Use `git init` to initialize project directory.
- `git RM` remove files and add those deletions to staging.
- `git ADD --ALL` set all changes to staging.
- `git checkout -b [new branch name]`
- `git branch -m [branch name] [new branch name]` changes branch names.
- `git branch -d [branch name]` deletes branch.
- `git merge [branch name]` merges branch changes onto current branch.

- `git clone [URL] --bare` (grabs all of the branches as well)
- `git config --bool core.bare false` (from Lynda, reset configs)
- `git reset --hard` (resets project to original state from last pull)

# Remotes
`git remote -v`
Get list of Remotes
