# Summer of Tech 2017
Ruby Masterclass with Powershop
Andy at Flux Federation (Formally Powershop)

### Contents
1. Some talk about Dynamic Languages
2. Background on Ruby
3. Live coding
4. Some challenges
5. Futher reading

## Dynamic Languages
- Python, Clojure, JS, Ruby, Lua...
- Run-time type checking
- Can change types at Run-time
- No build steps
- Usually no type declarations
- Often a bit slower, less efficient, less safe
- Industry is packed with tech that runs dynamically

## Background on Ruby
- Invented by Matz.
- Developer optimized
- Good community

## Basics
- Just about everything returns an object
- Can call methods on any object, even primitives and strings
- Even 'True' and 'False' are classes

## Booleans
- `== != < > etc`

## Ranges
- (1..10)
- rand(1..10) >> 5

## Time
- Time.now
- Easy to work with time, find offsets etc

## Blocks
- Chunk of runable code (can be used on a set, object, etc)
`fruit.detect do |f|
   f.include?("a")
 end`
- Methods can be easily overwritten

## Events
- Railsn00bs Wellington (meetup.com)
- WellRailed (meetup.com)
- Rails Girls
- Wellington Ruby
- KiwiRuby conference
