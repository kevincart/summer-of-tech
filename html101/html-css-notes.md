These are Kevin Cartwright's Notes

Regular, Regular Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic. Good font sets need at least these.

## SASS and CSS Pre-processors
Allow us to use new features without worrying about browser standards
Functions, Loops etc.
Requires an extra step to implement (compiling)
Autoprefixer allows you to skip a lot of work..
SCSS, LESS other standards
node-sass *** Check it out!!

## Some nice features of SCSS
Nested selectors
Partial imports (see lesson code for links)
@extend
@mixin

## Mobile First, Responsive Design
Roughly 70% of traffic is mobile now
@media queries are useful for setting breakpoints
'#{}' to use variables in SCSS
Remember also to set a max-with, to prevent overflowing text on larger monitors!

## Advanced selectors
'&:last-child' grabs the last of a selected set of elements
'[data-attribute]' selector, grabs data- attributed elements.
  !Can select [any attribute!]
'::before', '::after' pseudo elements

## Flexbox
Starts out with 'display: flex;'
Starts as inline block, then allows you to adjust the relationships
Flexbox Froggy, game to learn flexbox

## CSS Grid
boston.com a good example of CSS grid
Columns and Rows, with control over how they flow
